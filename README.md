# A Generic Role Playing Game (pun intended)

## Task
### English
Implement class structure described below on a diagram [UML diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language).
Add all files in the `Entities` directory separating classes into `.h` and `.cpp` files.
Include all relevant headers in the `Entities/Entities.h` file.

### Polski
Zaimplementuj strukturę klas przedstawioną na schemacie poniżej [UML diagram](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language).
Dodaj wszystkie pliki w katalogu `Entities`, dzieląc klasy na pliki `.h` i `.cpp`.
Załącz wszystkie potrzebne pliki nagłówkowe w `Entities/Entities.h`.

## Rulebook

### Clarifications:
The weight of the character is the sum of its body mass and all equipment he carries.
Character can carry any number of items that fit in a sack of size `100`.
Character can wield only one weapon, and wear only one armor.
Character's speed is equal to it's strength divided by his total weight.

### Description:
The `getDescription` function should return a string that (as the name suggest) describe the item/character, and should include (for a character):
- Name (if present)
- Race
- Decorators
- Weapon (if any)
- Armor (if any)
- other Items (if any)

for instance:
`a half-wit orc, wielding a brick, wearing a plate armor, and carrying some socks and a severed hand`

### JSON
The `getJSON` function should return a computer-readable data about the item/character in the [JSON format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON). For example (for the same character as above):
```json
{
	type: "Character",
	name: "",
	race: "orc",
	adjectives: [ "half-wit" ],
	wield: {
		type: "Weapon",
		name: "brick",
		power: 5,
		weight: 1,
		size: 0.5
	},
	wears: {
		type: "Armor",
		name: "plate armor",
		armor: 50,
		weight: 20,
		size: 3
	},
	carries: [
		{
			type: "Armor",
			name: "socks",
			armor: 2,
			weight: 0.03,
			size: 0.01
		},
		{
			type: "Item",
			name: "severed hand",
			weight: 5,
			size: 1
		}
	]
}
```

## Requirements

Only files in the `Entities` directory will be considered as solution.
